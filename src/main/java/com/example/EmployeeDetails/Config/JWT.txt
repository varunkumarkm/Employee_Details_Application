JWT (JSON web tockens)

What is JWT in REATApi?
-> JSON Web Tokens, known as JWTs are used for forming authorization for users. This helps us to build secure APIs 
   and it is also easy to scale. During authentication, a JWT is returned. Whenever the user wants to access a protected resource, 
   the browser must send JWTs in the Authorization header along with the request.
   
In online we need to search, write a code for JWT token with rest api signin

step-1: Add the dependency  
<dependency>
	<groupId>io.jsonwebtoken</groupId>
	<artifactId>jjwt</artifactId>
	<version>0.9.1</version>
</dependency>

step-2: If any thing goes wrong with JWT tocken we throw an exception to the users for that we create on class
is JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint 

step-3: add the secrit key on application.properties file

The JWT tocken is made-up of 3 parts are:
1) Header: Header information which as algoritham 
2) PAyload: just like a JSON object
3) signature: secreate key, nobody can copying this

step-4: Create a JwtAuthenticationFilter class
step-5: create a JwtTokenProvider class
step-6: update the AuthController class
step-7: Create a JWTAuthResponse class
